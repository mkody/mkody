### Kody (André F.)

Hi and welcome. I'm André Fernandes, a [CFC](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificat_f%C3%A9d%C3%A9ral_de_capacit%C3%A9) software developer who currently has three main goals.

1. Make software to help people share their passions.
2. Talk about the things I'm passionate, in an audio or video form.
3. Have enough money to live peacefully, pay all the server bills and some for mobile gacha-games. ~~(I'm not sorry)~~

I mostly do my projects in PHP (usually with the [Fat-Free Framework](https://fatfreeframework.com/)) and VueJS, but I also write in Python and NodeJS.

If you want to email me, add `b4tp0n` in the subject line and send it to `gh{at}kdy.ch`.  
I will otherwise not take your message seriously and might blacklist your address/domain.

#### Things I currently run

- [Radio Brony](https://radiobrony.fr/), a webradio for My Little Pony: FiM fans. We have a lax "non-pony is allowed" rule in place so we can talk about anything else, that way people who don't care about pastel-colored horses can come and enjoy some of our shows.
- [im-in.space](https://im-in.space/), a Mastodon (and [Pleroma](https://pl.im-in.space/)) instance. Decentralized is the way of the future, but it only works if the instance can stay online for long enough. This is why I made a commitment to keep the service afloat for as long as I don't forget to renew the domain. Note that the rules are set at my own discretion and I will take action if something personally bothers me.
- [Rita.moe](https://rita.moe/), just a small place to host files/mails/code with people I can trust.


#### Things I'm working on

- [toonsquad](https://toonsquad.co/), a cartoon tracking service with the goal of also being a source to learn more about the production and the people behind the shows.
- [Double-Clic](http://double-clic.show/), a short weekly (maybe triweekly in the future) French podcast to keep being up-to-date with subjects that I think interest a lot of Internet passionates. The format is based on what _Les Croissants_ did every morning, and I want to cover most subjects that [NoLife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolife_(TV_channel)) did and maybe more.
- pods.onl, a software and service so you can launch and host your podcast without signing for weird terms and exclusivity. And you get a nice website that you can customize with your own template.
