### Kody (André F.)

Hi and welcome. I'm André Fernandes, a [CFC](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificat_f%C3%A9d%C3%A9ral_de_capacit%C3%A9) software developer who currently has three main goals.

1. Make software to help people share their passions.
2. Talk about the things I'm passionate, in an audio or video form.
3. Have enough money to live peacefully, pay all the server bills and some for mobile gacha-games. ~~(I'm not sorry)~~

I mostly do my projects in PHP (usually with the [Fat-Free Framework](https://fatfreeframework.com/)) and VueJS, but I also write in Python and NodeJS.
